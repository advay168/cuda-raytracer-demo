# Cuda Raytracer Demo

A small demo to demonstrate CUDA support in clangir.

## Build and run instructions
### Quickstart
- Run `make`

### Behind the scenes
- Run `./compile.py`. It might be able to adapt to your computer, but if it doesn't, change the configurations (variables with capital letters).
- Run `build/raytracer`.
